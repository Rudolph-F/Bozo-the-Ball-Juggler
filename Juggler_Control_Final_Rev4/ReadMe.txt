Same as Rev 3 but this program allows the user to save the various offsetes to the EEPROm.
By hodling in the E Stop button once the motors have been disabled
This version also allows the user to add zero angle offsets to the motor if the zero position limit switches are moved or not installed at the correct positions.
This is the final version of the program
